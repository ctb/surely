You'll need bowtie v1,

       http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

to run this.  bowtie 0.12.7 is the latest release of bowtie 1, and will work.

You will also need screed,

       http://github.com/ctb/screed/

installed in your PYTHONPATH.

You also need pygr.  I'm trying to fix that, it's not a very important
requirement :).
